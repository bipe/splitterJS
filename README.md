### Description
SplitterJS is a simple application built with Javascript on HTML and Bootstrap to make it easier to split the check (or bill) in restaurants, bars and the like.

### How to use it

1- Add the people involved in a table by name and check the box if they want to pay the service tax (10% of his/her bill).  
2- When everyone is added to the table, check the green button of the first step.  
3- Then, add each product, its value and who consumed it. Note that you have to separate the names of the consumers with a comma (,).  
4- When you're done, click the green button of the second step and the result should come off on the Results box.  


### Changelog

#### v1.0 ():
- Still lacks validation in some input fields;
- Portuguese (PT-BR) version only;
- Still works fine if you follow the rules.
